Here, you can find the six data files for the parser to generate.  The data files are for

1) Mad Russian Christmas (Trans Siberian Orchestra)
2) Holly Jolly Christmas (Burl Ives)
3) Joy to the World (Pentatonix)
4) Jingle Bell Rock (Bobby Helms)
5) Wizards in Winter (Trans Siberian Orchestra)
6) Linus and Lucy (Vince Geraldi Trio)
7) Carol of the Bells (Trans Siberian Orchestra)

It is critical that the data files only contain data for the parser and no additional comments.  Parser data includes only channel number, whether the outlet is on or off, and time intervals.
